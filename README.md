# Linear Regression from Scratch

This project implements **Linear Regression from scratch** using **NumPy**, without using any ML libraries. Both **univariate** and **multivariate** regression are implemented, along with **full gradient descent optimization** and **visualizations**.

---

## Features

- Univariate and multivariate regression
- Feature scaling / normalization
- Hypothesis function and MSE loss
- Gradient Descent optimization
- Cost function convergence visualization
- Regression line plotting
- Multivariate analysis using California Housing dataset

---

## Dataset

- **Univariate:** Salary Dataset  
- **Multivariate:** California Housing Dataset (from sklearn)
